# **Saumya Kothari - Computer Vision Project 1**

## **Part 1**
#### **DOMAIN:** 
Botanical research

#### **CONTEXT:** 
University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of
plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample
images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a
photo.

#### **DATA DESCRIPTION:** 
The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/
plant-seedlings-classification/data

#### **PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** 
University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of
determining a plant's species from a photo

**Steps and tasks: [ Total Score: 20 points]**
1. Import the data. Analyse the dimensions of the data. Visualise the data.
2. Train tune and test AIML image classifier model using:
• Use supervised learning algorithms for training
• Use neural networks for training
• Use CNN for training
3. Compare the results from the above step along with your detailed observations.
4. Pickle the best performing model.
5. Import the the image in the “ Prediction” folder to predict the class. Display the image. Use the best trained image
classifier model to predict the class.




## **Part 2**
**TASK:**

Explain in depth why CNN out performs neural networks which in turn out perform supervised learning
models when it comes to image classification. Use the markdown option in Jupiter for your answer.




## Part 3

#### DOMAIN : 
Automobile
#### CONTEXT : 
A brand research company wants to understand which cars or car manufacturers are popular in a
certain area of the city or locality. Company has a team which takes pictures of the cars randomly through the
day. Using this the company wants to set up an automation which can classify the make of the car once the
picture has been given as an input.
#### TASK : 
Help to build the image dataset to be used by the AI team to build an image classifier data. Import and
display the images in python against their labels. Comment on the challenges faced during this task.
Hint: An image classifier data requires images as data and their tags/labels/class to which they belong.




## Part 4

#### DOMAIN:
Botanical research

#### CONTEXT:
University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of
plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample
images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a
photo.

#### DATA DESCRIPTION:
The dataset comprises of images from 17 plant species. It can be downloaded from
TensorFlow [ Hint: import tflearn.datasets.oxflower17 as oxflower17 ]

#### PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of
determining a plant's species from a photo

**Steps and tasks: [ Total Score: 25 points]**
1. Import the data. Analyse the dimensions of the data.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Data visualisation:
• Display the images
• Display the labels
• Display images vs labels
• Apply different filters [ for example: blur, contour, edge detection, emboss, smooth etc.] on the images and
display the image.
4. Train tune and test AIML image classifier model using:
• Use supervised learning algorithms for training
• Use neural networks for training
• Use CNN for training
• Use various CNN with transferred learning models for training
• Compare the results from the above step along with your detailed observations.
5. Create a GUI to import the image “Prediction.jpg” and use the above designed AIML image classification model to
predict the class/label of this image.



## Part 5
Explain in depth your strategy to maintain and support the AIML image classifier after it in production
